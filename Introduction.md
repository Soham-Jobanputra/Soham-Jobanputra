## Intro:

​	  I am Soham, I am kind of a simple guy. As I am in late teenage, My interest towards programming grows more and more daily. I am fascinated by the idea of "Anyone can program almost everything!".  I am inspired by the idea of "Open Source". I does little competitive programming as a side hobby.

​	  I am really amazed and inspired by websites like https://www.shadertoy.com/ and https://thelifeengine.net/, python libraries like Manim by 3b1b and Pandas, YouTube videos like https://youtu.be/clKo8FrWJww?si=wm-aXiYlDS1WEibE , https://youtu.be/KPoeNZZ6H4s?si=IUiYkdjijlG7EanD and https://youtu.be/zXPiqk0-zDY?si=PT5ocxyawLuptfqw and many more like https://youtu.be/PMpNhbMjDj0?si=K7irZOnDKCHq3lw0 and https://youtu.be/5oXyibEgJr0?si=QuntQNdUgqzBsxxA. There are a lots of things that keeps me involved in programming that cannot fit in a little intro like this.

​	  I likes Unix like operating system as its open source and I am also willing to study them. My favourite programming Language is C, although I almost always writes code in Python in order to just implement logic, but its same thing under the hood you know :grin:. I like C because its like a DIV language, its almost like a survival Minecraft where user/player needs to collect resources and create cool things out of it. Another cool language is C++ because of its rich Standard Template Library, at first I thought its super-set of C but its not.
